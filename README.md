# Discord-Basic-Nuke
A small, non-destructive Discord bot demo built with Node.js and discord.js that shows how to implement common admin features (prune, archive, warn, safe snapshot) while enforcing permission checks and keeping operations reversible and safe. Intended for education and responsible server administration.
